## Core Features:

- AI-Powered BMC Generation: Generate AI-powered Business Model Canvases (BMCs) from a business description, leveraging an LLM to populate a dynamic BMC layout. The LLM tool uses provided answers to refine canvas content.
- Business Description Input: Enable users to input a business description and answer multiple-choice questions to tailor the BMC generation.
- Dynamic BMC Layout: Display dynamically populated BMC layouts with clear, editable sections after the initial generation.
- Template Selection: Allow users to select from at least 3 visual templates to change the look and feel of their canvas. Paid plans will allow to create and save template options.
- Export Canvas: Offer users the ability to export generated canvases in PDF and PNG formats for external use.
